Cat: How did you find it?! 
Dusk: Magic.
Cat: Haha, that's what my mom used to say too.
Cat: How was it? Seeing it in person? 
Dusk: It really was beautiful. I wish you got to see it in person.
Cat: This photo will do. I feel at ease looking at the photo. 
Cat: It fills me up with an emotion I quite can't describe but, I'm happy. 
Cat: I miss my mom. She loved these flowers.
Cat: Anyways, thank you. I hope this gem is of use to you.
Cat: I'm gonna think for a bit.
